## Homework #06

#### Branching and Looping

Give an assembly language implementation that is equivalent to each of the following high level language programs.

   1. A program that rounds an integer up to the next closest even integer.
      ```
      int x;
      Read x;
      if (x % 2 != 0) {  // if x is odd.
         x++;
      }
      Print x;
      ```

   1. A program that computes the whole number part of the log base 2 of an integer.  The log base 2 of a number is the number of times that it can be divided by 2 before reaching the value 1.  One way to do this is to use integer division and count how many times the number can be divided by 2 before getting a result that is less than or equal to 1.  Hint: The `SHR` operation should help you here.
      ```
      int a;
      int log = 0;

      Read a;
      while (a > 1) {
        log++;
        a = a / 2;   // Integer division by 2.
      }

      Print log;
      ```

   1. A program that reads a specified number of positive integers from standard input and prints out the largest value read.
      ```
      int n;
      int max = 0;

      Read n;
      for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
         Read j;
         if (j > max) {
             max = j;
         }
      }
      Print max;
      ```

   1. A program that computes the sign function of a provided value:

      ![Sign function](hw06-signum.jpeg)

      ```
      int x;

      Read x;

      if (x < 0) {
         Print -1;
      }
      else if (x == 0) {
         Print 0;  
      }
      else {
         Print 1
      }
      ```
