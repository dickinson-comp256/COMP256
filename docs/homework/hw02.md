## Homework #02

#### Simplifying Logic Circuits

1. Use truth tables to show that DeMorgan's And and Or Boolean identities are valid.

1. Apply DeMorgan's Identities to the following expressions:

1. Recall from Class 04 the logic circuit and corresponding expression below:
![Logic Circuit](hw02-simplifycircuit.jpeg)
![Logic Expression](hw02-simplifyexpr.jpeg)

Also recall that we used the Boolean Identities to show that the above expression (and thus the circuit also) could be simplified (steps omitted here - see the Class04 slides):
![Logic Expression](hw02-simplifiedexpr.jpeg)

Use the Boolean Identities to show that this expression could also be simplified to:
![Logic Expression](hw02-simplifiedexpr2.jpeg)

Hint: Try starting from end result above and applying another identity.

1. Use Boolean Identities to simplify the following Logic Expressions.

1. A set of gates is called _universal_ if they are sufficient to implement any Boolean function. Any Boolean function can be represented as a truth table by simply listing the output for all possible combinations of the inputs.  We saw in class that if we create a truth table, we can then create an SOP expression and from that expression build a circuit for it using just AND, OR and NOT gates.  Thus, the set of gates {NOT, AND, OR} is universal.

   That may not be too surprising, but what might be more surprising is that NAND by itself is universal (note: NOR is as well). One way to show that NAND is universal is to show that we can build NOT, AND and OR using only NANDs.  Show NAND is universal by constructing circuits using only NAND that compute:

   1. NOT
   1. AND
   1. OR
