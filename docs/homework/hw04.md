## Homework #04

#### Stored Programs and Micro-Instructions  

1. The ALU in the [Knob & Switch Computer](http://users.dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/dpandmem.html) includes operations `\|` and `&`. Experiment with these operations.  Briefly explain what these operations compute and give an example of each.  Hint: Using base 2 values might help.

1. Give micro-programs for the Knob & Switch [Micro-Programmable Machine](http://users.dickinson.edu/~braught/kands/KandS2/micromachine.html)
that perform the computations indicated below. You may hand enter values into the main memory before running your program.  However, your program should not assume that 0 or any other specific values exist in the registers when your program begins.
   1. `MM[4] = MM[5] + MM[3]`
   1. `MM[2] = 8 * MM[1]`
   1. `MM[3] = MM[2] - 2 * MM[1]`
   1. Set `MM[2]` to be the two's complement of `MM[1]`. Note you cannot do this by flipping bits and adding 1 on the Knob & Switch because it does not have an instruction for flipping the bits. Hint: Taking the two's complement of a number changes its sign. Use other operations to make that happen, then confirm that you do in fact get the two's complement of your original number.
   1. Set `MM[2]` to be `MM[1]` with its 8 most significant bits set to 0 and its 8 least significant bits unchanged.  Hint: You will need to use your answer from the prior question about `&` and `\|` and make a special value available in another memory location.  Be sure to indicate the value you used and the memory location where you stored it along with your answer.

#### Machine Language Instructions  

1. Coming Soon

<!--
Can make this a little longer since we don't have class on Friday.

1. Absolute value

1. sum of numbers from 1 to n.

1. Question on how to create branch on equal?  Branch on greater than or less than, etc...

1. Assume a and b are positive - do multiplication - long pain in ass.


1. May have noticed that some opcodes have bit patterns that do actually correspond to switch positions.  This is a common design technique for machine languages.  Why might machine designers do this? Does it still count as abstraction?

1. Question about true/false boolean conditions using just the 3 branching instructions.
