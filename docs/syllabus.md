## Syllabus

### Course Description

A broad examination of the role and evolution of the abstraction hierarchies that enable the construction of complex computing systems. Examples spanning the field of computer science will be used, including: machine organization and architecture, data representation, language translation, operating systems, concurrency, networks, and web application architectures.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

This course assumes at least a semester of prior object-oriented programming in Java. The nominal prerequisite is Dickinson COMP132 - Principles of Object-Oriented Design.

### Learning Goals

Students will:
- understand the role that abstraction plays in organization and architecture, networking, operating systems, web application architectures
- understand basic binary data representation including unsigned and signed integers, floating point values and character data.
- recognize the primary tradeoffs and engineering concerns that arise in the design of complex computing systems.
- [WiD goal] be able to use metaphor and analogy to explain complex technical concepts to an audience of peers.

### Course Schedule

Details including topics, assignments and due dates are indicated on the [Course Home Page](https://dickinson-comp-256.github.io/website/).

### Textbook

There is no text required for this course.  Reading and other materials for COMP256 will be provided via links on the course schedule, embedded in the assignments, or via Moodle.

### Communications

All communications outside of in person meetings will occur via Teams. Communication in public channels is preferred.  However, sensitive conversations should be initiated as a private chat. Please do not send e-mails.

### Office Hours

A list of my office hours and availability is provided on my home page (users.dickinson.edu/~braught/). If you have conflicts with my regularly scheduled office hours or would like to schedule a separate meeting please message me on Teams. Please do not send e-mails.

### Instructional Elements

#### Attendance & Engagement

Your presence and engagement in class are important elements to learning and thus are required elements of this course.  Engagement includes attentiveness, active listening, responding to questions, participating in small group activities and asking questions.

Unexcused absences will result in a 0 score for the class or lab period. Excused absences will be omitted from the scoring. Each student in attendance on a given day will receive a ✓, which may then be changed to a ✓- after the class period if the instructor observes repeated or extended periods of disengagement, or inappropriate or disruptive classroom behavior.

Anticipatable absences may be excused if arranged with the instructor in advance. Absences due to emergencies may be excused if discussed with the instructor as soon as possible after the absence. _For Spring 2022:_ In the current time of COVID concerns, please err on the side of caution and do not come to class if you are feeling unwell - just message the instructor on Teams in advance and follow [campus protocols](https://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/1539/spring_2022_semester_information).

#### Homework Activities

Homework activities start from the introductory material seen in the class meeting but will also contain additional videos/readings and will guide you through the learning of new material that adds depth and/or extends the introductory material.  

Each activity will typically be due at the start of the next class meeting.  Within a unit of the course, each class builds on the prior one. So, having completed an activity from one class meeting provides the foundation necessary to be prepared for the next. Please allocate enough time in your schedule so that you can complete each activity before the next class meeting.  You should expect that each activity will require 2-3 hours of work.  Note: This is consistent with Dickinson’s standard that “[Credit for courses is based on the assumption that at least three hours of study accompany each class period](https://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/10480/academic_policy_and_procedures.pdf).”

##### Homework Grading

Each question in the homework activities will be indicated as essential (:key:) or enhanced (:trophy:). When being graded, each question will be marked as:
- x: Little to no effort on the question.
- ✓-: Progress has been made but answer fails to demonstrate an adequate understanding of the relevant material.
- ✓: Answer demonstrates some understanding of the relevant material, but contains a significant error, does not address all parts of the question, or is not written in complete sentences.
- ✓+: Answer clearly demonstrates an understanding of the relevant material.

Each homework activity will be given an overall score of 0, 1, 2 or 3:
- 0: Not submitted or essential questions have received x scores.
- 1: Progress has been made on all essential questions (✓- or ✓).
- 2: All essential questions have received ✓+ scores.
- 3: All essential questions and the majority of enhanced questions have received ✓+ scores.

Any homework activities receiving scores of 0, 1 or 2 may be resubmitted within 1 week of being returned.

#### Lab Activities

The labs provide in-depth hands-on experience with the topics covered in the course.  The number and frequency of labs will vary by unit throughout the course. Labs are designed to be _nearly_ completable during the two hour lab period.  However, to allow additional time as necessary, they will be due at the start of the following lab period.

Labs in this course will be completed in pairs and/or small groups at the instructor's discretion. All work on the lab must be completed in collaboration with your partner(s). Collaboration between pairs/groups is not permitted and no individual work is permitted on labs without prior approval from the instructor. The instructor will assign pairs/groups and they will change regularly throughout the semester. Changing pairs/groups exposes you to a wider variety of ways of thinking and allows knowledge and techniques to spread throughout the class in an organic way. I highly encourage you to share ideas and techniques with your lab partners.

Lab activities will be graded using the same approach as described above for Homework Activities.

#### Mid-Term Exams

All written exams are strictly individual work. They will be time-limted, hand written and given during a class or lab session. These exams will be closed notes and closed book. However, you will be permitted one 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper (single sided) of hand written notes that can be read with the naked eye. Because of the inherently cumulative nature of this course, each exam will necessarily rely on content from previous exams. However, the emphasis of each exam will be on the material introduced since the previous exam.

Mid-Term exams will be graded on a 100% scale with partial credit given on individual questions.

#### Final Exam

The final is strictly individual work. It will be timed (3 hours), hand written and given in the classroom. This exam will be closed notes and closed book. However, you will be permitted three 8.5" x 11" sheets of paper (single sided) of hand written notes that can be read with the naked eye.

The final exam will be graded on a 100%  scale with partial credit given on individual questions.

### Course Grades

Final course grades will be assigned using a competency based grading scale. One of the main ideas behind competency based grading is that all students who satisfactorily complete the course have demonstrated a basic competency with all of the essential material in the course. To this end, the table below clearly specifies the requirements for each letter grade. To receive a letter grade all of the stated requirements for that grade must be met.

Grade  | Requirements
------ | ----------------------
D      | - 70% check for class & lab attendance and engagement<br>- 85% scores of 2 on homework, with no 0's<br>- 85% scores of 2 on labs, with no 0's
C      | - Meet all criteria for D<br>- 80% check for class & lab attendance and engagement<br>- 100% scores of 2 on homework<br>- 100% scores of 2 on labs
B      | - Meet all criteria for C<br>- 85% check for class & lab attendance and engagement<br>- 65% scores of 3 on homework<br>- 40% scores of 3 on labs
A      | - Meet all criteria for B<br>- 90% check for class & lab attendance and engagement<br>- 85% scores of 3 on Homework<br>- 70% scores of 3 on labs

Exam scores will be averaged with each midterm having a weight of 25% and the final exam having a weight of 50%.  This average will then be used to adjust the grade based on the above criteria either up or down according to the following table:

Exam Average | Adjustment
------------ | ---------------
&gt;90%      | Move up one full letter grade (e.g. C becomes B)
&gt;80%      | Move up one half letter grade (e.g. C becomes C+)
&lt;70%      | Move down one half letter grade (e.g. C becomes C-)
&lt;50%      | Move down one full letter grade (e.g. C becomes D)

### Tokens

Each student begins the semester with 5 tokens.  A token may be used to submit an assignment late but within 1 week of its due date, to resubmit an assignment after the resubmission deadline or to resubmit an assignment an additional time (i.e. a 2nd or 3rd time). Opportunities may be presented throughout the semester to earn additional tokens.

### Writing in the Discipline (WiD)

This course is part of the WiD thread in the Computer Science Major. Students completing the Computer Science Major satisfy the WiD graduation requirement by maintaining a portfolio of assignments from the courses on the [WiD Thread](https://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/402/computer_science_curriculum).  Several Lab and/or homework assignments in this course will be dedicated to this writing assignment and must be completed with a score of at least 2 to count toward the WiD credit.

### Academic Integrity

Please take the time to read the Academic Misconduct section of [Dickinson's Community Standards](https://www.dickinson.edu/download/downloads/id/11821/community_standards.pdf). Violations of this policy are considered serious transgressions, so you should be especially certain that you understand your rights and responsibilities under it. Students suspected of academic dishonesty will be subject to the process outlined in the [Student Conduct](http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/69/student_conduct) pages. The specific collaboration policies for each component of this course are detailed in the assignments. If you are unsure about whether or not certain kinds of collaboration are permissible on an assignment or in this course, ask your instructor

### Accommodations for Disabilities

Dickinson values diverse types of learners and is committed to ensuring that each student is afforded equitable access to participate in all learning experiences. If you have (or think you may have) a learning difference or a disability – including a mental health, medical, or physical impairment – that would hinder your access to learning or demonstrating knowledge in this class, please contact Access and Disability Services (ADS). They will confidentially explain the accommodation request process and the type of documentation that Dean and Director Marni Jones will need to determine your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. To learn more about available supports, go to [www.dickinson.edu/ADS](https://www.dickinson.edu/ADS), email access@dickinson.edu, call (717) 245-1734, or go to the ADS office in Room 005 of Old West, Lower Level (aka "the OWLL").

If you’ve already been granted accommodations at Dickinson, please follow the guidance at [www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan](https://www.dickinson.edu/AccessPlan) for disclosing the accommodations for which you are eligible and scheduling a meeting with me as soon as possible so that we can discuss your accommodations and finalize your Access Plan. If test proctoring will be needed from ADS, remember that we will need to complete your Access Plan in time to give them at least one week’s advance notice.

“Our classroom / My office is located on the second floor of Tome Hall, which has an elevator, located to the left of the main entrance. If you require the use of an elevator to access the second floor, please let me know. If there is ever a malfunction with the elevator please let me know (e.g. via Teams or e-mail).  I will if necessary relocate or hold class virtually. Similarly, if you are ever unable to reach my office for office hours or a meeting I will be happy to move the meeting to an accessible location or hold it virtually.

### Life Happens:

Sometimes stuff just happens, even more so in the challenging situations in we currently find ourselves. Sometimes it is an unexpected sudden event such as an illness or family emergency. Other times it may be an ongoing issue or concern or an accumulation of smaller issues. Any of these things may affect your (or my) ability to focus or perform up to your (or my) potential through no shortcoming or fault of your (my) own. Dickinson is a kind and caring community and we want to see you achieve at your full potential. So, if you are experiencing life events that are affecting your performance please don’t hesitate to talk to your instructor, your advisor or your class Dean. They will all be willing to talk with you, help to formulate a plan and/or connect you with others that may be able to assist. If I am experiencing such events, I will communicate them to you as well. In all cases we will make reasonable adaptations.
